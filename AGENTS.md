# Agent Guidance

## Starting Point

At the start of every task, read [Go Auth Engine — Design Context](docs/agents/init.md)
before planning or changing this project. It is the persistent starting point for
the authentication engine's goals, domain vocabulary, and design constraints.

Treat that document as project context. Its examples and suggested first coding
task do not authorize implementation on their own; the user's active request
determines the work to perform. Apply the workflow below to that work, and follow
any later explicit user decisions that revise the design context.

## Project Shape

Firestarter is a Go service template. Treat it as a backend repository unless the task explicitly introduces another product surface.

Key paths:

- `api/`: protobuf API contracts.
- `cmd/`: application entrypoint and dependency wiring.
- `config/`: runtime configuration.
- `domain/`: domain entities, repository interfaces, gateway interfaces, and domain services.
- `application/`: application commands and queries.
- `delivery/`: generated-contract adapters, API handlers, and feature workers when introduced.
- `driver/<dependency-component>/<implementation>/`: reusable concrete dependency adapters.
- `generated/`: generated protobuf and xo output.
- `internal/pkg/`: shared infrastructure packages such as connectors, middleware, health checks, and workers.
- `tools/migrations/`: Goose database migrations.
- `tools/xo-templates/`: xo database model generation templates.
- `docs/`: cross-feature product and architecture reference material.
- `prompt/`: reusable spec-driven development prompts.
- `spec/`: feature specifications.

Library code is public at the root; `internal/testutil` is reserved for test-only support.

## Skill Routing

Use repository skills from `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` when a matching skill exists. Read the full `SKILL.md` before acting.

Common routing:

- Any persistent stateful feature or aggregate review: `define-aggregate-boundaries` first to choose the smallest transactional roots, locking boundaries, and simple domain vocabulary.
- Cross-aggregate workflow or durable state-change events: `design-event-driven-aggregates` after aggregate boundaries are approved.
- End-to-end or cross-layer feature delivery: `deliver-feature`, then only the specialized skills selected for the current task.
- Application service work: `application-layer`.
- API handlers, workers, consumers, and delivery mapping: `delivery-layer`.
- Domain entities and value objects: `domain-entity`.
- Repository interfaces or PostgreSQL implementations: `repository-layer`.
- Gateway interfaces or third-party clients: `gateway-layer`.
- Protobuf contracts and field validation: the external `protobuf-schema-authoring` skill when installed, then `field-validation`.
- Error classification and wrapping: `error-handling`.
- Tracing: `tracing`.
- Repository or gateway method-file organization: `method-per-file`.
- Optional constructor or public API arguments: `go-functional-options`.
- Focused Go style, naming, helper extraction, and uncertain design decisions: `go-code-style`, `naming`, `function-decomposition`, and `engineering-judgment`.
- Lint and verification cleanup: `go-linter-workflow`.
- Project placement questions: `project-layout`.

For an end-to-end feature, use `deliver-feature` as the coordinator and load the most specific skills task by task. For an isolated change, skip the coordinator and use the narrowest matching skill directly. Do not load broad style skills when no corresponding decision is present.

## Review Feedback Learning Loop

When human review feedback concerns behavior governed by an existing repository skill, update that skill in the same logical change as the code or documentation correction.

- Preserve the concrete reusable rule, not the one-off identifier or file name.
- Update only the skill that owns the concern; do not scatter the same instruction across unrelated skills.
- Keep the skill concise and consistent with higher-priority repository guidance.
- Run `make skills-validate` after the skill change.
- Mention the skill update in the review handoff.

When feedback is narrowly phrased, encode the smallest reusable rule that would have prevented the reviewed mistake.

## Go Development Workflow

Follow the existing architecture and generated-code boundaries.

- Keep domain types and interfaces under `domain`.
- Keep shared infrastructure primitives under `internal/pkg`.
- Put migrations in `tools/migrations`.
- Do not edit generated files by hand when they can be regenerated.
- Use `gofmt`/`goimports` style through the project tooling.
- Keep tests close to the package being changed.

Useful commands:

- `make dependency`: install project generator tools and add or update the template's unpinned helper dependencies; review resulting `go.mod` and `go.sum` changes.
- `make infra`: start local dependencies.
- `make migrations-up`: apply migrations.
- `make migrations`: destructively reset and re-apply the local database; use only when a local reset is explicitly safe.
- `make pb`: update Buf dependencies, lint protos, and generate protobuf code.
- `make xo`: regenerate xo database models from the local database.
- `make generate`: run protobuf, xo, and `go generate ./...`.
- `make fmt`: run the configured formatter.
- `make linter`: run `golangci-lint`.
- `make skills-validate`: validate repository-local skill frontmatter, metadata, references, and scaffold cleanup without external Python packages.
- `go test ./...`: run the Go test suite.

Run the narrowest relevant verification during iteration, then broaden to package or repository checks when the change affects shared behavior, generated contracts, or wiring.

## Generated Code

When changing protobuf contracts, migrations, or generation templates, run the matching generation command and include generated output in the same logical change.

- Protobuf changes usually require `make pb`.
- Migration/schema changes usually require `make migrations-up` and `make xo` against local Postgres.
- Cross-cutting generated-code changes usually require `make generate`.

If local infrastructure or required generators are unavailable, report the exact command that could not be run and why.

## Domain Events

Use [Vibox](https://github.com/not-for-prod/vibox) when an approved feature requires durable domain-event publication. Follow `docs/domain-events.md` for the project boundary and delivery contract.

- Keep typed business events and event publisher ports under `domain`; domain code must not import Vibox.
- Let application commands collect aggregate events and publish them through the domain-facing port in the same `txManager.Do` transaction as aggregate persistence.
- Keep Vibox record mapping, payload encoding, topics, partition keys, producers, and relays in infrastructure or delivery adapters.
- Treat relay delivery as at least once and make consumers idempotent.
- Do not add Vibox or its migration until an approved feature introduces a durable event contract.

## Spec-Driven Development

Use the SDD flow for non-trivial feature work. Small bug fixes, documentation updates, mechanical refactors, and narrow test additions do not need a full spec unless the user asks for one.

Before implementation for a non-trivial feature:

1. Complete a Mermaid-first event-storming model under
   `docs/event-storming/<feature-name>.md`.
2. Present the human review surface and obtain explicit approval:
   - sequence diagrams for happy, failure, and recovery paths;
   - the aggregate-root table with one-sentence purposes;
   - commands, emitted events, and cross-aggregate event routes;
   - decisions and open questions that affect observable behavior.
3. Keep this review surface concise and visual. Do not ask the owner to approve
   proposal, requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, or verification
   prose that only derives the already-approved model.
4. Start from the current base branch, normally `main`, and create a feature
   branch when branch management is in scope.
5. Create a feature folder under `spec/<number>-<feature-name>/`.
6. Use the prompts in order:
   - `prompt/00-proposal-to-requirements.md`
   - `prompt/01-requirements-to-acceptance-criteria.md`
   - `prompt/02-architecture-constraints.md`
   - `prompt/03-verification.md`
   - `prompt/04-task-list.md`
   - `prompt/execute.md`
7. Generate proposal, requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints,
   verification, and plan continuously as machine-facing implementation
   artifacts. Do not pause between these derived stages.
8. Return to the visual approval gate only when derivation or implementation
   introduces a new actor, aggregate, command, event route, observable product
   decision, compatibility break, or other meaningful scope change.
9. Start implementation when `verification.md` says ready and the user's active
   request authorizes implementation. A separately approved `plan.md` is not
   required when it only implements the approved visual model.

During execution, implement one planned task at a time and run its verification
commands. Use approval checkpoints only for a new decision, new authority,
material scope expansion, or risky/destructive action—not merely because a
planned code phase is broad.

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commit prefixes matching the repository style:

- `feat:` for user-facing features and implementation tasks.
- `fix:` for bug fixes.
- `docs:` for documentation-only changes.
- `test:` for test-only changes.
- `chore:` for tooling, generated files, or maintenance changes.

Before committing, check `git status --short` and avoid staging unrelated user changes.

## Working Tree Safety

The worktree may contain user edits. Do not revert or overwrite changes you did not make. If unrelated files are dirty, leave them alone. If user edits overlap with the task, read them carefully and build on top of them.
